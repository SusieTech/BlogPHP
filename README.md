# Hi Kate!
# Please review the "About Me" page as half of the team hate #GitHub!!
# I have included a text box which should return the user's comments once they have been entered.
# There is also an "Image Upload" function. For some reason it will get the image but the ".jpeg" image appears instead of the actual image.
# I am desperatly attempting to get some social media plugin's however I need some help with BootStrap it's really irritatiing my life lol!
